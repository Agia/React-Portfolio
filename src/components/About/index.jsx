            <p className="bold">Hi! I'm Alyssa.</p>

            <p className="text-info">(Obligitory web dev greeting =))</p>

            <p>I'm relatively new to web development - just coming to the end of a 16-week Front End Web Development Bootcamp, with no experience prior to that. With that in mind, my <Link to="/React-Portfolio/portfolio"><span className="link-inline">portfolio</span></Link> is currently made up of projects based off challenges (weekly assignments), from that course, that were all to be completed within a ~4-5 days, and were graded based on explicit criteria. As such, I have no client testimonials to share, but I thought I would share some feedback snippets from TA's and Graders from the course, related to the challenges in the portfolio section.</p>

            <p>Despite the short amount of time I have had in web development, I feel that I've finally found the career that was made for me. In no other profession have I ever found this incredible, stimulating mix of logic, specificity, problem-solving, design and creativity, that is inherent in web development. It absolutely feels like the career I was meant to do.</p>
